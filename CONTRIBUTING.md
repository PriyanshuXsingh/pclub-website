## ðŸš€ Project Setup

## ðŸ”§ Code Standards and Linting

We use **ESLint** to enforce code quality and **lefthook** for pre-commit checks.

### âœ… Before You Commit

- Run lint to check for issues:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Automatically fix lint errors:

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

- **Note:** A `lefthook` pre-commit script will run `npm run lint` automatically. Make sure all linting issues are resolved before committing.
